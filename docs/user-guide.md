# MealMeter User Guide

MealMeter is a restaurant feedback application that allows patrons to submit structured feedback about their dining experience directly at the point of sale. Patrons can rate food quality, cleanliness, and service, leave a written review, and optionally add tags. Owners can then review, sort, filter, organise, and manage the submitted feedback from a separate management view.

Once logged in, the **Owner Management** tab shows a table of submitted reviews. The table includes:

### Filtering Reviews

You can filter reviews using one or more of the following fields:

- **Include Tags**: only show reviews that contain all listed tags.
- **Exclude Tags**: hide reviews that contain any listed tags.
- **Status**: show `All`, `Resolved`, or `Outstanding` reviews.
- **Conditions**: apply numeric filtering conditions.

Tags should be separated by commas, for example:

```text
slow service, crowded
```

Supported condition format:

```text
<criterion> <operator> <value>
```

Examples:

```text
food > 4
service == 5
cleanliness >= 3.5
overall < 2.5
```

Supported criteria are:

- `food`
- `cleanliness`
- `service`
- `overall`
- `tag count`

Partial matching is also available for criteria such as:
- `fo` matches `food`
- `tag` matches `tag count`

Supported operators are:

- `>`
- `>=`
- `==`
- `!=`
- `<`
- `<=`

You may enter multiple conditions separated by commas, for example:

```text
food >= 4, service >= 4
```

After entering your filter settings, click **Apply Filter**.

Notes:

- Leave fields blank if you do not want to use them.
- Use **Refresh** to return to the full review list after filtering or sorting.
- Condition input must match the implemented parser format exactly.

### Marking a Review as Resolved or Outstanding

To update a review's follow-up status:

1. Select a review from the table.
2. Click **Resolved** to mark it as resolved.
3. Click **Outstanding** to mark it as unresolved again.

This is useful for tracking whether a review has already been followed up on by the restaurant.


### Adding Tags to an Existing Review

To add tags to a review that has already been submitted:

1. Select a review from the table.
2. Click **Add Tags**.
3. Enter one or more tags separated by commas.
4. Confirm the input.

MealMeter will add only the new tags. Existing matching tags will not be duplicated.

Example:

```text
priority, refund requested
```


### Deleting Tags from an Existing Review

To remove tags from a review:

1. Select a review from the table.
2. Click **Delete Tags**.
3. Enter one or more tags separated by commas.
4. Confirm the input.

Only matching tags will be removed. Non-existent tags will be ignored and reported back to the user.

Example:

```text
refund requested, waiting time
```


### Deleting a Review

To permanently delete a review:

1. Select a review from the table.
2. Click **Delete**.
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

Deleted reviews are removed from storage and cannot be recovered through the application.


### Refreshing the Review Table

Click **Refresh** to reload the full review list into the owner table.

This is useful when:

- you want to clear the current filtered or sorted view
- new reviews were submitted while you were logged in
- you want to return to the latest saved state in the main review list

### Logging out

Click **Logout** to end the owner session.

After logout:

- the application returns to the Patron Feedback tab
- the owner-only table is cleared from view
- owner-only actions are no longer available until you log in again

## Data Storage

MealMeter stores review data locally in:

```text
data/reviews.txt
```

This file is created automatically if it does not already exist. Reviews are saved automatically whenever:

- a patron submits a review
- an owner resolves or unresolves a review
- an owner adds or deletes tags
- an owner deletes a review

This means your data will still be available the next time you open the application from the same folder.

## FAQ

### Where are my reviews saved?

They are saved locally in `data/reviews.txt` relative to the folder where you run the application.

### How do I return to the full list after filtering or sorting?

Click **Refresh** in the Owner Management view.

### What is the default owner password?

The default password is `password`.

### Can patrons access the owner features?

No. Owner features require successful login through the Owner Management tab.

### Do I need to save changes manually?

No. MealMeter saves review changes automatically.
